1,Andrew Ng is a legend. I took his course on Coursera and I wish the course never ended. I have taking a lot of Machine learning courses but none of them compare to Andrew's.

3,I am a 12th-grade student and really interested in machine learning. I did some basic math which is required in machine learning and am starting with this course today. I really liked the fact that the language which is used in this course is python. so excited to learn about this new branch. Will try my best to complete it.
